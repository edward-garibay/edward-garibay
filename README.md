## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, This is Edward Garibay

Hey! I'm Edward, a recent graduate from TripleTen Data Analytics bootcamp and a University of Texas alumni.

During my bootcamp I developed technical skills involving SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, ML, and more, completing multiple projects where you can read more on in my repository. 

Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the Media and Communications sphere to drive growth and boost sales. 

With 3+ years of sales experience, I've developed a proven track record in exceeding quotas, CRM strategy optimization, and sales operations. I specialize in securing high-value investments, building strong client relationships, and delivering personalized outreach campaigns that boost lead conversion rates and exceed revenue targets.

I bring a blend of analytical thinking and relationship-building skills that allows me to excel in dynamic, fast-paced environments. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven decision-making and innovative sales techniques to maximize results and fuel business growth.

Some facts about me:
  - I enjoy all things fitness; running, lifting, basketball, pickeball, etc.
  - I just completed my first marathon in Austin with a 3 hour time.
  - I'm working on becoming a certified personal trainer to help individuals with their own fitness journeys
  - I am actively a funded trader trading indices futures

My goal for 2025 is to land a job in Data analytics.
